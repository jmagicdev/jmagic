/**
 * 702.32. Madness
 * 
 * 702.32a Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a
 * static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player's
 * hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability
 * is applied. "Madness [cost]" means "If a player would discard this card, that
 * player discards it, but may exile it instead of putting it into his or her
 * graveyard" and "When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by
 * paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn't, he or
 * she puts this card into his or her graveyard."
 * 
 * 702.32b Casting a spell using its madness ability follows the rules for
 * paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and 601.2e-g.
