/**
 * 702.94. Overload
 *
 * 702.94a Overload is a keyword that represents two static abilities: one that
 * functions from any zone in which the spell with overload can be cast and
 * another that functions while the card is on the stack. Overload [cost] means
 * "You may choose to pay [cost] rather than pay this spell's mana cost" and "If
 * you chose to pay this spell's overload cost, change its text by replacing all
 * instances of the word 'target' with the word 'each.'" Using the overload
 * ability follows the rules for paying alternative costs in rules 601.2b and
 * 601.2e-g.
 *
 * 702.94b If a player chooses to pay the overload cost of a spell, that spell
 * won't require any targets. It may affect objects that couldn't be chosen as
 * legal targets if the spell were cast without its overload cost being paid.
 *
 * 702.94c Overload's second ability creates a text-changing effect. See rule
 * 612, "Text-Changing Effects."
