 * A class implements the {@link Castable} interface to indicate it can be cast.
 * Classes that implement this must implement the following defaults:
 * <ul>
 * <li>An object that's both a land and another card type (for example, an
 * artifact land) can only be played as a land. It can't be cast as a spell.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from his or her hand
 * during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast a creature card from his or her hand
 * during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from his or her
 * hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast an instant card from his or her hand.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast a planeswalker card from his or her
 * hand during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.</li>
 * <li>A player who has priority may cast a sorcery card from his or her hand
 * during a main phase of his or her turn when the stack is empty.</li>
 * <li>Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal
 * card follows the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card
 * type.</li>
 * </ul>
 * See {@link Castable.Simple} the implementation you must delegate to.
