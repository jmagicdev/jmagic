/**
 * Represents a replacement effect that applies to damage. Extend this class and

 * damage replacement effects.
 * 
 * When extending this class, be careful that your effect is modifiable by
 * text-change effects. This is accomplished by using a SetGenerator whenever an
 * enum is referred to (color, for example). If this is clear as mud, look at
 * Luminesce. Rather than just checking the damage sources for RED and BLACK, it
 * stores a SetGenerator (really just a Identity) containing those colors, then
 * evaluates the generator when actually doing the match. Since evaluating a
 * SetGenerator applies text change effects to the evaluation, if any text
 * change effects are changing Luminesce, the colors to match against will be
 * correctly updated.
