/**
 * 901. Planechase
 *
 * 901.1. In the Planechase variant, plane cards add additional abilities and
 * randomness to the game. At any given time, one plane card will be face up and
 * its abilities will affect the game. The Planechase variant uses all the
 * normal rules for a _Magic_ game, with the following additions.
 *
 * 901.2. A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The
 * default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack
 * multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option.
 * See rule 806, "Free-for-All Variant."
 *
 * 901.3. In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a planar
 * deck of at least ten plane cards and the game needs one planar die. Each card
 * in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule 309,
 * "Planes.")
 *
 * 901.3a A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol
 * {PW}. One face has the chaos symbol {C}. The other faces are blank.
 *
 * 901.4. At the start of the game, each player shuffles his or her planar deck
 * so that the cards are in a random order. Each deck is placed face down next
 * to its owner's library. All plane cards remain in the command zone throughout
 * the game, both while they're part of a planar deck and while they're face up.
 *
 * 901.5. Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities
 * of cards that allow them to start the game with those cards on the
 * battlefield, the starting player moves the top card of his or her planar deck
 * off that planar deck and turns it face up. (See rule 103.6.) No abilities of
 * that card trigger as a result.
 *
 * 901.6. The owner of a plane card is the player who started the game with it
 * in his or her planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane card is the
 * player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller
 * is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller
 * would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn't
 * leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller
 * leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until he
 * or she leaves the game or a different player becomes the active player,
 * whichever comes first.
 *
 * 901.7. Any abilities of a face-up plane card in the command zone function
 * from that zone. The card's static abilities affect the game, its triggered
 * abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
 *
 * 901.7a Each plane card is treated as if its text box included "When you roll
 * {PW}, put this card on the bottom of its owner's planar deck face down, then
 * move the top card of your planar deck off your planar deck and turn it face
 * up." This is called the "planeswalking ability." A face-up plane card that's
 * turned face down becomes a new object.
 *
 * 901.8. Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but
 * only during a main phase of his or her turn, that player may roll the planar
 * die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number
 * of times he or she has previously taken this action on that turn. This is a
 * special action and doesn't use the stack. (See rule 115.2f.)
 *
 * 901.8a If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player
 * gets priority.
 *
 * 901.8b If the die roll is the chaos symbol {C}, any ability of the plane that
 * starts "When you roll {C}" triggers and is put on the stack. The active
 * player gets priority.
 *
 * 901.8c If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol {PW}, the plane's
 * "planeswalking ability" triggers and is put on the stack. The active player
 * gets priority.
 *
 * 901.9. When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player leave
 * the game. (See rule 800.4a.) If that includes the face-up plane card, the
 * planar controller turns the top card of his or her planar deck face up. This
 * is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the
 * game.
 *
 * 901.9a If a plane leaves the game while a "planeswalking ability" for which
 * it was the source is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.
 *
 * 901.10. After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of his or
 * her planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has
 * "planeswalked." Continuous effects with durations that last until a player
 * planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger.
 * See rule 701.21.
 *
 * 901.10a A player may planeswalk as the result of the "planeswalking ability"
 * (see rule 309.6) or because the owner of the face-up plane card leaves the
 * game (see rule 901.9).
 *
 * 901.10b The plane card that's turned face up is the plane the player
 * planeswalks to. The plane card that's turned face down, or that leaves the
 * game, is the plane the player planeswalks away from.
 *
 * 901.11. A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the
 * Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase
 * casual variant, with the following additions.
 *
 * 901.11a Each player has his or her own planar deck.
 *
 * 901.11b The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active
 * team. However, if the current planar controller's team would leave the game,
 * instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn't leave
 * the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller's team
 * leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until he
 * or she leaves the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever
 * comes first.
 *
 * 901.11c Even though the face-up plane is controlled by just one player, any
 * ability of that plane that refers to "you" applies to both members of the
 * planar controller's team.
 *
 * 901.11d Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of
 * them may roll the planar die. Each player's cost to roll the planar die is
 * based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the
 * planar die that turn.
 *
 * 901.12. In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards are exempt
 * from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects
 * of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game.
 * (See rule 801, "Limited Range of Influence Option.")
 *
 * 901.13. In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards may be face up
 * at the same time.
 *
 * 901.13a Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will
 * start the game with a turn marker moves the top card of his or her planar
 * deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. Each of them is a planar
 * controller.
 *
 * 901.13b If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game
 * would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases
 * to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller),
 * then that player leaves the game. The face-up plane card that player
 * controlled is put on the bottom of its owner's planar deck. No player is
 * considered to have planeswalked.
 *
 * 901.14. Single Planar Deck Option
 *
 * 901.14a As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a
 * single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar
 * deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in
 * the game, whichever is smaller. Each card in the planar deck must have a
 * different English name.
 *
 * 901.14b In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar
 * controller is considered to be the owner of all the plane cards.
 *
 * 901.14c If any rule or ability refers to a player's planar deck, the communal
 * planar deck is used.
